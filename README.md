# Project Description

This repository includes Python code for simulating an imaginary marketplace for user medical data. I call the Platform.

# About the Platform

In an ideal world, we would like the anonymized personal medical data to be available for analysis by the most talented data scientists. The users should be compensated for their participation in the data trials. The research should be sponsored by a (potentially self-interested) third party, e.g. a university medical center. The platform models this ideal world as a game between the users, the data scientists, and the research sponsors. 

# Implementation

Python Notebook; packages used: numpy, random, math, matplotlib.
